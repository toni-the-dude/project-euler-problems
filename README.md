# ProjectEulerProblems
My solutions to problems posted on Project Euler.

If any of them seem out of order, that is because I originally started solving whatever problem seemed solvable and didn't keep track of their IDs.

Every folder will eventually be named after the ID and name of the problem as presented on [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/). They will also contain:
- A "Task.txt" file
- Folders named after the language in which the solution is written
